## Overview

ComfyDeploy V2 APIs bring significant improvements in performance and features. This guide will walk you through the two main steps required to upgrade from V1 to V2.

### Step 1: Ensure ComfyDeploy node is up-to-date

Reccomend to use [`v2.1.0`](https://github.com/BennyKok/comfyui-deploy/releases/tag/v2.1.0) aka `62f8e388bb5217bb0472cb14bd7bf2d417225017` or any recent version

#### RunPod V2

> **Warning:** We are not actively maintaining the runpod worker image, please get into contact with us if you need help.

For runpod, you will have to update your own docker image configuration,

```dockerfile
# v2.1.0
RUN git clone https://github.com/BennyKok/comfyui-deploy.git && cd comfyui-deploy && git reset --hard 62f8e388bb5217bb0472cb14bd7bf2d417225017
RUN cd comfyui-deploy && pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

or by using our latest pre-built image `bennykok/comfydeploy-runpod-worker`

### Step 2: Update API integration

V2 API uses new endpoints. You'll need to update your API integration as follows:

| API Version | Base URL |
|------------|----------|
| V1 (Old) | `https://www.comfydeploy.com/api/` |
| V2 (New) | `https://api.comfydeploy.com/api/` |

If you are using SDK, ensure you update to the latest SDK

```bash
bun install comfydeploy@latest
```

> **Warning:** We are not actively maintaining the python and ruby SDKs since less usage as we are seeing, please get into contact with us if you need help.

#### API Endpoint Changes

| Endpoint | V1 (Legacy) | V2 (Current) |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Create Run | `POST /run` | `POST /run/deployment/queue` |
| Get Run Status | `GET /run?run_id={run_id}` | `GET /run/{run_id}` |

> **Note:** Remember to update your base URL from `https://www.comfydeploy.com/api` to `https://api.comfydeploy.com/api`

### Step 3: Test Your API Integration

If you are using ComfyDeploy Machine, you are all set.

#### RunPod V2

To verify your RunPod V2 migration, test your API with the following endpoint:

```bash
POST /run/deployment/queue
{
"deployment_id": "5ca368a0-d99d-43a2-b0ff-5111efb707de",
"flags": ["runpod_v2"]
}
```

> **Warning:** We will soon migrate all RunPod V1 users to V2, and using old comfydeploy custom nodes will break after April 15th.

This test will help ensure your integration is working correctly with the V2 API.

> **Note:** Make sure you're using the new base URL: `https://api.comfydeploy.com/api`
