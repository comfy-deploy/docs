description: Download models to your private volume in Comfy Deploy
---

Comfy Deploy gives you your own private volume that holds your models. It gets connected to `comfyui/models` so you can populate your own models directories with the models you want from anywhere.

You can start downloading models in your [models page](https://app.comfydeploy.com/models).

# Downloading models

We will need 3 things to download a model:

1. Model to download (link or upload)
2. Filename
3. Model folder to download to

## Huggingface repo

If you want to download a repo from huggingface go to the repo page and get the repo identifier e.g. `linoyts/yarn_flux_700_stable_flow_vital_4`

> **Note:** You can set your Huggingface token in the [settings page](https://app.comfydeploy.com/settings) to download models with permissions.

## Civitai

You can download models from [Civitai](https://civitai.com/) to Comfy Deploy by using the [model page link](https://civitai.com/models/618692/flux?modelVersionId=691639).

## Link

We can also take any link someone can download from!

> **Note:** A good way to tell if the link is correct, is to go to the link in your browser. 
> 
> If it starts a download of the file it should be good!

### HF Link
if you want to download a file from huggingface, you can go to the specific file page.
For example, this [flux lora](https://huggingface.co/alvdansen/flux_film_foto/blob/main/araminta_k_flux_film_foto.safetensors) copying the download link.

> **Note:** You can set your Huggingface token in the [settings page](https://app.comfydeploy.com/settings) to download gated models.

## Upload

You can upload models locally to your Comfy Deploy volume.

> **Warning:** Depending on your internet connection, this can be much slower than downloading from a link.
