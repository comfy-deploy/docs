description: Use ComfyUI in the cloud with Comfy Deploy workspace
---

Comfy Deploy let's you use ComfyUI in the cloud. We call this the workspace which you can access for each of your workflows.

The components that make a workspace are:
1. [Machine environment](/v2/machines/environment) - custom nodes, python packages, etc.
1. [Models folder](/v2/models/download) - checkpoint, vae, etc.

> **Note:** The machine that your workflow is attached to needs to be built to use and see ComfyUI.

## Sessions 

Sessions let you spin up a GPU in the cloud to run your workflow. 

You will be asked to select a `timeout period`. The maximum amount of time your session will last for.

> **Warning:** Currently you cannot add time while being in the session.

> **Note:** If you want to add new models to your account. You can do so by going to the [storage page](https://www.comfydeploy.com/storage).
> 
> Once the model has finished downloading, you will need to restart your session to be able to use the model.
