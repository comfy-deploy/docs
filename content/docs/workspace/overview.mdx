## Why We Upgraded the Workspace

The previous workspace UI/UX had significant usability issues that made workflow development cumbersome and inefficient. For example, if you wanted to install custom nodes or models while working in a session, you had to:

1. Exit the current session
2. Navigate to the corresponding machine page
3. Edit the machine configuration
4. Wait for the machine to rebuild
5. Return to the workflow page
6. Close and restart the session

This workflow was absolutely frustrating and clunky for developers who needed to iterate quickly on their ComfyUI workflows.

## The New Dynamic Island Experience

We've completely redesigned the workspace with a beautiful **Dynamic Island** navigation system that brings all essential features to your fingertips. The new interface features a glassy, modern design with smooth animations and intuitive organization.

## Dynamic Island Navigation

The Dynamic Island organizes all workspace functionality into three main sections:

<Cards>
  <Card title="Workflow" href="/docs/workspace/sessions">
    **Machine & Model Management**
    
    Configure your execution environment, install custom nodes, and manage models without leaving your session.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Playground" href="/docs/workspace/playground">
    **Gallery & Testing**
    
    Test your workflows, browse generated outputs, and organize your results with the integrated gallery.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="API" href="/docs/workspace/deployment">
    **Requests & Deployment**
    
    Monitor API requests, view deployment status, and manage your workflow versions.
  </Card>
</Cards>

## Workflow Version Management

At the top left corner, you can easily:
- **Switch between workflows** - Jump between different projects seamlessly
- **Select workflow versions** - Choose specific versions of your current workflow
- **Version control** - Track changes and manage your workflow evolution

## Getting Started

To begin working with your upgraded workspace:

1. **Select your GPU configuration**
   - Choose "CPU" for simple editing and cost savings
   - Select a strong GPU for complex workflows and intensive computations

2. **Set session duration** - Configure how long you need the session to run

3. **Start your session** - Launch into the new Dynamic Island experience

The new workspace eliminates the friction of the old workflow, allowing you to focus on creating amazing ComfyUI workflows without interruption.
