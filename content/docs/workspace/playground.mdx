## Enhanced Input Management

### Grouping and Reordering

The playground now supports advanced input organization:

- **Group Related Inputs** - Organize similar parameters together for better workflow
- **Reorder Input Position** - Arrange inputs in the most logical order for your workflow
- **Custom Organization** - Create a structure that makes sense for your specific use case

This makes complex workflows much more manageable and user-friendly, especially when sharing with team members who may not be familiar with the technical details.
