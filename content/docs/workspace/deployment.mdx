## Deployment Interface

The deployment section of the workspace provides comprehensive management of your workflow deployments, version control, and API request monitoring.

## Environment Management

### Deployment Environments
Manage multiple deployment environments for your workflows:

- **Production** - Live deployments serving real users and applications
- **Staging** - Testing environment for validating changes before production release

Each environment shows:
- **Version Information** - Current deployed version (e.g., sd 1.5, v5)
- **Deployment Status** - Active status and health indicators
- **Last Updated** - Timestamp of most recent deployment
- **API Documentation** - Direct access to API docs for each environment

## Version Control

### Version Management
The versions panel provides complete control over your workflow iterations:

- **Version History** - Complete list of all workflow versions (v6, v5, v4, v3, v2, v1)
- **Reordered Inputs** - Track input organization changes across versions
- **Version Comparison** - See what changed between different versions
- **Deployment Actions** - Deploy specific versions to different environments

### Version Actions
For each version, you can:
- **Link Share** - Generate shareable links for testing
- **Deploy to Production** - Promote versions to live environment
- **Deploy to Staging** - Test versions in staging environment
- **Deploy Latest** - Quick deployment of the most recent version

## Request Monitoring

### API Request Tracking
Monitor your deployed workflow's usage and performance:

#### Request Filters
- **Environment Filter** - View requests by production, staging, or all environments
- **Time Range Filter** - Focus on specific time periods (Last 1 day, custom ranges)
- **Request Type Filter** - Filter by different types of API calls

#### Request Analytics
- **Request Volume** - Track usage patterns and traffic
- **Response Times** - Monitor performance metrics
- **Error Rates** - Identify and troubleshoot issues
- **Usage Statistics** - Understand how your API is being used

### Request Status Monitoring

The requests section shows detailed information about:
- **Recent Activity** - Latest API calls and their status
- **Success Rates** - Percentage of successful requests
- **Error Analysis** - Detailed error reporting and debugging information
- **Performance Metrics** - Response times and throughput statistics

## Seamless Workflow Integration

### Dynamic Island Navigation
Access deployment features without leaving your development context:
- **Switch from Workflow** - Move from editing to deployment management
- **Return from Playground** - Deploy tested workflows immediately
- **Integrated Experience** - All workspace features work together seamlessly

### Deployment Workflow
The typical deployment process:

1. **Develop in Workflow** - Create and edit your ComfyUI workflow
2. **Test in Playground** - Validate functionality and outputs
3. **Commit Version** - Save your workflow as a new version
4. **Deploy to Staging** - Test in a production-like environment
5. **Monitor Requests** - Verify performance and functionality
6. **Deploy to Production** - Release to live users

## Advanced Features

### Deployment Configuration
- **Auto-scaling Settings** - Configure how your deployment scales with demand
- **Resource Allocation** - Set GPU and memory requirements
- **Environment Variables** - Manage configuration across environments
- **Health Checks** - Set up monitoring and alerting

For detailed deployment configuration and advanced features, check out the [deployment documentation](/docs/deployments) for comprehensive guides on setting up and managing your ComfyUI workflow deployments.

The deployment interface brings enterprise-grade deployment management directly into your workspace, eliminating the need to switch between multiple tools and dashboards.
