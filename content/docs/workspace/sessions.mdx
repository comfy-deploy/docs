## Session Interface

The new session interface brings all essential tools into a unified Dynamic Island navigation system. Everything you need is now accessible without leaving your session.

## Expanded Menu Features

Click the menu icon to access powerful session management tools:

### Core Tools
- **Log** - View detailed logs of your workflow runs and debugging information
- **Assets** - Import and manage media files you've uploaded to your assets library
- **API Nodes** - Access the wiki for all supported API nodes to enhance your workflows
- **Model Check** - Verify that all required inputs and models are properly configured

### Advanced Features
- **Integration** - Connect with external services and tools
- **Configuration** - Customize your session behavior

### Configuration Options

#### Auto Save
Set an automatic save interval (e.g., every 30 seconds) to prevent workflow loss during development. This ensures your work is continuously backed up.

#### Auto Expand Session
Automatically extend your session when time is running low. 

> **Warning:** Use this feature carefully! If you forget to close the session, it will continue running and incur GPU usage costs in the background.

## Session Timer Management

The session timer appears as a floating indicator when your session is active, even when you switch between different pages in the workspace.

### Timer Features
- **Time Remaining Display** - Shows exactly how much time is left in your session
- **Add Time Button** - Extend your session duration without interruption
- **Close Session (X)** - Safely terminate your session

### Important Session Closure Notes

When ending your session:

1. **Stay on the page** - Don't close the browser window immediately
2. **Wait for confirmation** - Allow several seconds for the session to close completely
3. **Verify closure** - Incomplete session endings may cause the session to continue running in the background, resulting in unexpected GPU costs
