ComfyDeploy is the easiest way to deploy ComfyUI API.

You can do this by going to your deployment page while in a workflow (left hand side menu).

Let's go through step by step

### Workflow inputs

Workflow inputs are the inputs of your currenlty selected version. 

> **Note:** Learn more about workflow inputs [here](/v2/deployments/inputs).

### Deployments

Each workflow can have up to 2 deployments `production` and `staging`.

A deployment is a specific version of your workflow, connected to a machine. Identified by a `deployment_id`. 

> **Warning:** If you change a machine that is already deployed, the deployment will be effected.
> 
> Make sure this is what you intend.

### Calling your API

Follow the instructions in your workflows deployment page.
