Import your ComfyUI workflow JSON file directly into ComfyDeploy. The system will automatically detect custom nodes and create a new machine for you.

### Step 1: Import workflow file

Drag and drop your workflow JSON file into the designated window.

### Step 4: Conflicting Nodes

Some nodes have the same name in different node packs. If you have some of these nodes you will be asked to select them.

### Step 5: Model checking (Beta)

Comfy Deploy checks popular nodes with models to see if you already have them.

> **Note:** ComfyUI can only use models that have the exact name in it's models folder.
