You can manage your current and previous versions of the serverless machine you've created regardless of status, environment, or specifications from the [dashboard](https://app.comfydeploy.com/machines?view=deployments).

## Version List

![Machine version list showing 9 versions with different statuses and timestamps](https://cd-misc.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/docs/machine_version_list.png)

The version list shows all iterations of your machine, including:

- Version number and creation timestamp
- Status (Ready, Failed, Building)
- Build logs and specifications
- Actions available for each version

Each version maintains a complete snapshot of your machine's configuration at the time it was created, allowing you to track changes and rollback if needed.

**Version would be created when:**

- You create a new machine
- You do a breaking change and update the machine (i.e. renaming will not create a new version)

## Version Details

- View the status and specifications of the machine
- View the custom nodes and commands used to build the machine
