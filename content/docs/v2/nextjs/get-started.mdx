## Overview

Install the TS client

```bash
bun i comfydeploy
```

For example setting up the ts client, get your api key [here](https://www.comfydeploy.com/api-keys)

```typescript client.ts
import { ComfyDeploy } from "comfydeploy";

export const cd = new ComfyDeploy({
    bearer: "<api-key>",
});
```

Running any workflow as API, for more types definitions see [here](https://api.comfydeploy.com/)

### Queue Run

When using queue run, an run id is returned immediately, which you can later use to check the status of the run or get the output.
Webhook callback is suggested making sure you have a way to receive the response.

```typescript
const run = await cd.run.deployment.queue({
  deploymentId: "<deployment-id>",
  inputs: {
    prompt: "A beautiful landscape",
  },
  webhook: "<your domain>/webhook"
})

// run.runId
```
