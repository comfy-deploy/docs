title: Create Environment
description: Define the environment your workflow will run in
---

A machine defines the environment your **workflow** will run in.

## Why define the environment?

> **Note:** By defining the environment in a machine, it allows us to be sure that if call us via API, or your teammate wants to use your workflow. It will behave the same way it did with you.
> 
> No more "it works on my machine" problems, you all share the same machine (config)!

## How

We give you 2 ways to define your environment.

- `Custom Nodes`
- `Docker Commands`

### Custom Nodes

You can easily add any custom node that you would find in **ComfyUI Manager** via our picker.

> **Note:** We will use the latest version of the node by default. If you want to use a specific version, you can set the hash of the custom node.

### Docker Commands

Machines also support docker commands in machine settings.

> **Note:** We follow the dockerfile command convention, read more [here](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/).

![Docker commands](/images/machine/docker-commands.png)

Here are some templates for common uses of docker commands.

#### System packages
If you need specific system packages

Change:
- `<package-name>` with the name of the package you want to install.
```dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y <package-name>
```

#### Models in custom node directories
Some custom nodes require models to be installed in the custom node directory.
Update:
- `<CustomNode-Directory>` with the name of the custom node directory.
- `<model-url>` with the url of the model.

```dockerfile
RUN wget -P /comfyui/custom_nodes/<CustomNode-Directory> <model-url>
```

#### pip packages
Update:
- `<package-name>` with the name of the package you want to install.
```dockerfile
RUN pip install <package-name>
```

#### Custom nodes
Update:
- `<git-url>` with the url of the git repository you want to install.
- `<custom-node-name>` with the name of the custom node you want to install.
- `<commit-hash>` with the hash of the commit you want to install.
```dockerfile
WORKDIR /comfyui/custom_nodes
RUN git clone <git-url> --recursive
WORKDIR /comfyui/custom_nodes/<custom-node-name>
RUN git reset --hard <commit-hash>
RUN if [ -f requirements.txt ]; then python -m pip install -r requirements.txt; fi
RUN if [ -f install.py ]; then python install.py || echo "install script failed"; fi
```
