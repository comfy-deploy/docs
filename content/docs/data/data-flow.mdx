This document outlines the core data flow in ComfyDeploy, focusing on what matters most to you: your workflows, run history, and outputs.

## Data Components

| Component | Type | Storage | Access |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Workflows** | `.json` | `postgres` | `Dashboard` / `API` |
| **Models** | `.safetensors` | `volume` | `Dashboard` / `API` |
| **Run records** | `.json` | `postgres` | `Dashboard` / `API` |
| **Inputs** | `.png` / `.jpg` / `.webp` | `s3` | `Dashboard` / `API` |
| **Outputs** | `.png` / `.jpg` / `.webp` | `s3` | `Public unique URL` / `Dashboard` / `API` |

> **Note:** This is a high-level overview of ComfyDeploy's data flow. Some technical details and advanced features may be simplified for clarity.

> **Warning:** Custom S3 Integration requires a Business Plan.
