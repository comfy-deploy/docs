```json
{
  "run_id": "run_12345",
  "status": "completed",
  "deployment_id": "deployment_67890",
  "updated_at": "2024-01-15T10:32:15Z",
  "outputs": {
    "result": "output_data"
  },
  "error": null // only present if status is "failed"
}
```

## Status Values

- `queued`: Run is waiting to be processed
- `running`: Run is currently executing
