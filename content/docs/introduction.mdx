## Overview

We do this by letting your team share the same **custom nodes environments**, **models** and **workflows** with your teams. 

### Getting Started Steps

1. **Import your workflow**
   Either via the dashboard (recommended) or from your local ComfyUI.

2. **Build a machine**
   Define a [machine](/v2/machines/environment) configuration to run your workflows on.

3. **Download models**
   Download [models](/v2/models/download) into your private storage, to be used in your workflows and team.

4. **ComfyUI in the cloud**
   Use ComfyUI in your [workspace](/docs/workspace/overview), to modify and test your workflows on cloud GPUs with the new Dynamic Island interface.

5. **Expose inputs**
   Expose workflow inputs with [our custom nodes](/v2/deployments/inputs), for API and playground use.

6. **Deploy APIs**
   Power apps with your [API deployments](/v2/deployments/create).

7. **Share with team**
   Let your team use your workflows in [playground](/v2/team/playground) without using ComfyUI.
